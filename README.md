# FrontendMentor.io-Challenges
My solutions to some of the FrontendMentor.io training challenges.


## Why Do This?
[FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) offers creative challenges for frontend developers to practice in real project workflows.
They give a "client brief" and provide design files, style-guides and leave the rest to you. Any UI libraries or tools are fair game, this is for practice after all!

## How do I see what you accomplished?
- This repo contains completed FrontendMentor.io challenges labeled by project name.  
- Each project folder contains all provided starter and design files along with my solution code.
- In each project README file I have added images of the desired challenge output alongside my solution layout for easy visual comparison.  The idea is that they look the same!

**Thanks for taking a look!**
